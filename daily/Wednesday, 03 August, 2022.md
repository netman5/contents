- Teach Student Git and Basic explanation of GitHub
	- Git as a local repository
	- Help with versioning of code
	- Allow developer to collaborate
	- Tracking of code
	- Tracking of who made changes
- What does Git do?

	-   Manage projects with **Repositories**
	-   **Clone** a project to work on a local copy
	-   Control and track changes with **Staging** and **Committing**
	-   **Branch** and **Merge** to allow for work on different part and versions of a project
	-   **Pull** the latest version of the project to a local copy
	-   **Push** local updates to the main project
- Working with Git

	-   Initialize Git on a folder, making it a **Repository**
	-   Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
	-   When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered **modified**
	-   You select the modified files you want to **Stage**
	-   The **Staged** files are **Committed**, which prompts Git to store a **permanent** snapshot of the files
	-   Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
	-   You can revert back to any previous commit.
	-   Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
- Getting started
	- Installed git for student
	- check git version `git --version`
	- configure initial git environment for student with ffg
		- `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
		- `git config --global user.email "jondoe@mail.com"`
	- Create new folder and initialize git
	- Create new files
	- introduce student to `git status` and file states
		- Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
		- Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
	- Staged file using `git add filename`
		- Used the shorthand of adding multiple files
			- `git add --all`
			- `git add .`
			- `git add -A` 
	- Commit files with commit message
		- Explained the -m means message
		- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
	- Explained committing without stage first by including -a
		- `git commit -a -m 'commit without staging' `
		- Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes and not recommended.
	- Git status shorthand `git status --short`
	- Git log to check the logs of commits
- Little intro to command line syntax
- Gave student first project and its due on Friday
