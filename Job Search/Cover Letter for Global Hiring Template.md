Dear [Employer],
I came across the open [role you’re applying for] position at [Company Name] and the opportunity got me very excited! [1-3 sentences explaining your interest in the role and the company].

However, I see that it’s only available for applicants in [countries they are hiring in]. I’d love to pass on this link to Oyster, a global employment platform that makes it easy to hire people anywhere in the world. They currently have some promotions, too, including one free hire for 12 months!

I’ve attached my resume and cover letter for this role. [1-2 sentences highlighting your candidacy].

Thank you so much for your time. I hope we can come up with a solution together to move my candidacy forward.

Sincerely,
