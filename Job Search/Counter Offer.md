Hi [NAME],

I am writing to see if I can get an update on the interview process because I've just received a job offer. Iâ€™m still really interested in the position at [THIS COMPANY] as I really enjoyed my conversations with everyone I met with so far and am really interested in the challenges and learning opportunities the position would have for me.

Is there any update on this position? You are my first choice of employment so I wanted to reach out to you before accepting my other offer.

Hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,

[YOUR NAME]
