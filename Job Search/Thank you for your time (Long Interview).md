Dear Mr. Jefferson,

Thank you very much for your time yesterday—it was a pleasure speaking with you about the account executive role. From our conversation, it’s clear that ABC Inc. has the energetic and hardworking environment I’m seeking.

I especially enjoyed discussing your need for someone who can create value and insight during client conversations. It’s an interesting challenge, and I’ve continued reflecting on it since our meeting. Over the last few years, I’ve encountered many of the same roadblocks we discussed: tightening client budgets and lengthy decision-making processes. Prioritizing the quality of the conversation over simple information delivery has been one of my most successful tactics in overcoming those roadblocks and one reason I’ve routinely exceeded my quotas.

In my relationships with clients, I focus on building trust and boosting credibility, and I’m excited about the prospect of bringing that skill set to ABC Inc. If you need any further information, please feel free to contact me by email or phone.

Thanks again,  
Jaime Peterson
