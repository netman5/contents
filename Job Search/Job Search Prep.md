How to Conduct Research For an Interview
Step 1: Research What the Company Says About Itself

Visit the company’s website. Your goal is to learn enough about the company that you’re able to discuss its goals and achievements in an interview setting. Here’s some information to pay attention to:

Their mission statement or goal. In an interview, you may be asked why you’re interested in this particular company; referencing their mission statement is a good way of responding. You might find this in the About Us or Our Mission section.

The name of the founder or CEO. No one is going to quiz you on this information, but if your interviewer mentions the CEO’s name and you say “Who is that?” it’s going to reflect negatively on you. You’ll probably find this in the About Us section.

What are they up to lately? Has the company been working on any recent projects? Pay careful attention especially if any of those projects relate to web/software development. You might find this information on the company website, or you might find it in their Twitter feed or LinkedIn posts.

What differentiates them from their competitors? What are their specific accomplishments? You might find this on any area of their site that discusses projects or accomplishments. If they have competitors, you can also Google “[Company name] versus [Competitor name]” and review the results.

What benefits do they offer? This information may have been listed on the job posting, but it’s a good idea to review it before an interview. You can find this on the Employment page.
What kind of employee are they looking for? Are they looking for a dynamic, fast-moving employee, or a reliable, steady one? You might find this information on their About Us, on their Employment page, or by reviewing the job post.
Step 2: Research What Others Say About the Company

If the company has a Glassdoor page, look at that first. Not all companies have Glassdoor profiles; if not, then look for reviews on Yelp, Google, Facebook, etc. If the company is very small or very new, you may not find anything, but always check. If the company does have reviews or ratings, look for the following information:

Are the employee or client reviews generally positive, negative, or neutral? Don’t worry if you see one or two negative reviews. If nearly all the reviews are negative, though, that might be a red flag.

Does the company have salary information?
Glassdoor allows you to filter salaries based on job title, and it’s important to review this information carefully. This will let you know whether the salary works for your situation, and will let you know how much room you have to negotiate a higher salary.

Has anyone posted interview questions? The Glassdoor pages of many companies, especially large ones, will often contain interview questions. Here are several examples of questions that Amazon asks prospective software engineers, for example. Review those interview questions, paying attention to both behavioral questions and technical ones.
Step 3: Research the Stages of the Interview Process

The content of your interview will probably vary depending on whether you’re conducting an initial phone screen or a pair-programming technical interview. Read over our curriculum on the Stages of the Interview Process and assess exactly which type of interview you’re attending.

Step 4: Research the Interview Location (yes, even if you’re having a Zoom interview!)

For in-person interviews:

Google map the interview site, and make sure you know how to get there.
Decide on a mode of transportation. If you’ll be taking public transportation, make sure that you completely understand bus/train routes, schedules, and ticket policies.
If your interview will be in a specific office in a large campus, find a map of the campus and locate the office.

Figure out how long it’ll take you to get there, and double it. If you think that it’ll take half an hour to reach your destination, be prepared to leave an hour early instead. This will help you arrive on time in the event of traffic or other delays.
If at all possible, visit the location beforehand. This will help you assess how long travel time will actually take.


For online interviews (one time-only tasks)

Download Zoom or Skype onto your phone. You should always try to interview on a laptop or desktop. However, you should also always have a backup plan in case of technical malfunctions. If your laptop breaks an hour before the interview is scheduled to start, you’ll feel a lot more comfortable knowing that you have a backup plan.
For online interviews (to complete before each interview)

Make sure that the area around you is clean and tidy; you don’t want your interviewer to see dirty laundry behind you!
Make sure that the area’s lighting is bright enough that your interviewer can clearly see your face. For a great tutorial on how to look good in video interviews, check out this fantastic video by NTD Training Videos. You’ll find not only lighting tips, but also suggestions for how to improve sound quality and more.
Have a friend (or one of your Microverse teammates) conduct a practice online interview with you. Ask them to give you feedback on your audio and video quality.
Step 5: If You Haven’t Already Done So, Research Yourself

We tend to recommend researching yourself earlier on in the job application process, ideally before you start applying for jobs at all. In fact, we give a thorough description of how and why to Google yourself in our “Online Presence” module--if you haven’t already done so, please check it out.

This is a step you only have to do once, so if you’ve already done a thorough self-Google check, feel free to skip to the next module. However, if you’ve never Googled yourself, it’s time to figure out what your prospective employers will see if they start researching you. Take a look at your social media profiles (both old and current) and make sure you’d feel comfortable if a potential employer found them. Depending on your preferences, you might choose to either delete less professional posts, or to make an entire social media profile private. That’s up to you. If you’d like a second opinion on which option to choose, feel free to ask your career coach, mentor, standup team, or job search Slack group.

How to Prepare For an Interview
Interview preparation is probably the most time-consuming aspect of the interview process, but luckily, by the time you finish Interview Prep, you will have acquired tons of interview practice! During your time in Interview Prep, you will conduct mock interviews with peers, strangers, industry professionals, and you will spend a great deal of time working on your answers to both technical and behavioral questions. In other words, you will have a great foundation for tackling interviews! So let's get started.

Step 1: Schedule Pramp interviews.

Pramp interviews are mock interviews that allow you to practice both your behavioral and technical skills with peers, strangers, and industry professionals. The more you practice, the better you become!

In Interview prep, you will have both Pramp behavioral interviews and Pramp technical interviews. To practice your phone screen or an initial interview skills, schedule a Pramp behavioral interview. To practice your technical interview skills, schedule a Pramp technical interview.

After each interview, take some time to review the feedback you were given, and to think about how you could have answered questions differently. If you find yourself struggling with one specific type of question, give that type of question some extra review.

Step 2: Review your Behavioral Grid!

You will have a lot of experience with behavioral questions, thanks to the Behavioral Grid you will create later in Interview Prep. Behavioral questions help a recruiter know how you operate in different situations. Practice your responses to those questions aloud, or ask a friend, Microverse mentor, or your job searching Slack group to quiz you, and then ask them to give you feedback.

Step 3: Get a Bit More Behavioral Question Practice

Your Behavioral Grid covers many of the most commonly asked behavioral questions, but you’ll probably encounter other types of questions as well! Take some time to review a few lists of common behavioral questions, such as Betterteam’s list of 25 common interview questions, or Fairygodboss’s list of 40 questions and answers. Come up with responses to a few of those questions, and practice reciting those responses aloud, making sure to follow the S-A-R format.

Step 4: Practice Any Glassdoor Interview Questions

In the research step above, we asked you to visit your prospective company’s Glassdoor page and review any available interview questions. Now, come up with responses to those interview questions. You’ll likely see a mix of behavioral and technical questions. Practice your responses to the behavioral questions while using the S-A-R format, then practice coming up with solutions to the technical challenges as well!

If your prospective company does not have a Glassdoor page, or if its page doesn’t contain any interview questions, run a Glassdoor search for the job title you’re applying for, and then look up any interview questions asked by other companies. We linked to some from Amazon above, but feel free to research questions asked by other companies, too!

Step 5: Practice Job Post-Specific Questions

A job post is essentially a summary of job duties, and you’ll likely be asked several questions either relating to your previous experience with similar job duties, or related to your potential to succeed with them. It’s a good idea to start preparing responses now.

Look at each job responsibility or qualification, and prepare short responses about your experience with those responsibilities or qualifications using the S-A-R format.  Let’s take a look at a few examples. We’ll list a few qualifications or job duties from a recent Microverse job posting, turn those qualifications into potential questions, and then briefly give example responses.

Qualification: At least one year of experience in one of the JS frameworks, preferably React.

Question: Tell me a little bit about your experience with React, or with any other Javascript framework or library.

Example Response: I’ve used React pretty regularly over the last two years, both as a student and as a developer. I used React while working on [briefly list or describe a few projects you’ve worked on with React]. I’ve also worked with AngularJS extensively, and Node.js in a more limited capacity, so while I’m most comfortable with React, I also know my way around other Javascript libraries as well.

Job Duty: Perform code reviews to ensure quality standards and best practices are used.

Question: You’ll be working with several junior engineers, and you’ll need to occasionally do code reviews to make sure they’re meeting quality standards. Talk to me about your feedback style, and how you’d help junior engineers learn and maintain best practices.

Example Response: I try to balance giving clear feedback with also giving the developer the opportunity to puzzle through a solution. I’ll point out areas of improvement and offer critique, and then I’ll try to send the student in the right direction, either by linking them to documentation or by suggesting a few options to try. When we have a quick turnaround time, that sort of Socratic method might not always be possible, but as much as possible I like code reviews to be a learning opportunity.

Qualification: Are eager to experiment and learn.

Question: Tell me about a time you displayed an eagerness to learn while at work, even outside of the scope of your regular job duties?

Example Response: I was recently working on building a backend using Rails but found myself having to repeat certain steps, so I decided to create my own Rails template. I’d never done that before, and at first I found myself having to deal with dozens of errors. But I knew that not only would building that template help me with my current project, but it would be something I could reference in the future, so I continued iterating. Since then I’ve actual built a few other templates, all of which have ended up decreasing the amount of time I spend debugging.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Your responses should be brief. If it takes you more than 2 minutes to recite a response, think about how to shorten it.
You might not have the perfect amount of experience for every bullet point, and that’s okay. Let’s say your interviewer asks you if you have Laravel experience, but you don’t. Your response should focus on what you do have. Here’s an example: “I haven’t used Laravel in many projects so far. I have used CodeIgniter, though, so I already have experience with PHP frameworks. I’m also constantly learning, so I’d love the opportunity to pick up Laravel.”
Don’t lie. It can be tempting to exaggerate your skills during a job interview, but doing so could eventually cause you a lot of trouble. Admit where your current knowledge might be lacking, and then talk about your applicable experience and how you plan to quickly pick up that new knowledge.
Step 6: Prepare questions to ask your interviewer. Asking questions shows the interviewer that you’re genuinely interested in the position, and that you want to learn more about the logistics.  Make a short list of 3-4 questions to ask the interviewer--just make sure not to ask questions you can easily find the answers to online, like “when was your company founded.” That will just make it seem like you haven’t done research.

If you’re struggling with coming up with questions, check out this list by Alison Green for a few examples.

Step 7: Read this short article on interview mistakes to avoid.

Make sure that you know what mistakes to avoid in an interview! This list by Rebecca Koenig is an excellent resource, so read it over and make sure that none of the examples apply to you!

For extra credit, check out this second article by Alison Green-- it talks about how to give a strong response if your interviewer asks why you left or were let go from previous jobs.
