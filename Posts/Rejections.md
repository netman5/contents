# Seeing Job Rejections the Positive way.

## What is Rejection?
Rejection is act of refusing to accept, use, or believe someone or something according to Cambridge dictionary definition. Rejections can come in different forms, social rejections where an individual is deliberately rejected from social relationship, romantic rejection, job rejection and others. A person can be rejected by individuals, an entire group of people or an organization. 

I'll like to believe that not all rejections is associated with a reason, some might spun out of pure sentiment or dislike. However, taking a step backward to knowing the reason for the rejection and working on it will reduced the chance of getting rejected again in the future.

As I mentioned earlier that rejections can come in many forms, for example in jobs application, it might be the company doesn't believe the applicant can do what they say they can or the candidate is not a cultural fit etc, that is why it is always a good thing and important to ask for feedback's anytime there is a rejection if theirs an opportunity to get one.

Rejections can be so demoralizing but seeing it in a positive way is a big plus. Currently on the job search, I remember the first few weeks after receiving so many rejections I was down & depressed for days. I even thought of giving up but after so many days and conversation with friends and my career coach I realized it is part of the process, that it is not personal.

There's is blessing in receiving a no, as much as it hurts, sometimes it can mean not now, a redirection, or an opportunity to check the process and see what is working and what is not, nature can even be helping you in dodging a bullet of a bad working environment. For example I noticed from Google Analytics that most visits to my portfolio originated from a mobile phones and this allows me to focus on improving the mobile responsiveness of the portfolio because the mobile view wasn't that responsive enough. As a result of their experience while visiting it doesn't lead to a call for an phone screen interview. Had it mean I don't receive the nos I won't get to know the mobile responsiveness is a mess and wouldn't know some of the reason I was getting the rejections. 

I also noticed I wasn't putting out qualities applications, I was just focused on applying for as much job as I can to get the numbers up. Blindly following the saying that Job search is a numbers game and not putting too much thought to the application materials e.g like tailoring the resume to suit the job role, writing a bespoke cover letters that makes me stand out. While using ATS optimization to check my resume I also found out that having the job title match the role title on the resume also increase the likeliness of being shortlisted for interview.

The above examples are just a few of the iterations but the point is rejections allow us to re-evaluate the process. A dev colleague said, receiving NOs is part of the process and set him up for a better future opportunities which I agreed.

Seeing rejections as a way to make a critical analysis of the process will help through the job search period and help build some resilient and mental toughness, even if it is not job related, it might be anything that is more personal. As software development is done in iteration so is job searching, you have to continue to deduce what works, what does not and continue to fine tune until you receive that one YES.

As at the time of writing this post I'm still on the job search, but trying to share my story for anyone trying to give up after so many rejections, to see receiving NO as part of the process and a way to see what is working and what is not. Having this information give you the option to make a better decision for future applications.
