Hello X!

As a student studying Software Development at Microverse Academy, I found your profile in the alumni database and found your career path and work in/at XXXX to be very interesting. I would like to know if we can schedule a 15-minute informational interview in the next few weeks, as I would like to get some advice on how to lunch my career.

Please let me know if you have the bandwidth now or of if we should connect in the future once your schedule opens up. I look forward to hearing back from you

Warmly,
Ola.
