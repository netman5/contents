# What Everyone Ought To Know About Teaching Others

The best way to learn is by teaching others what you have learnt. Explaining what you have learned to someone else will forces you to reword i.e. put it your own word and helps in revisiting it from ground up. It is also a perfect way to test if you've truly internalized something.

Sharing newly learned skills & knowledge helps solidifying the newly acquired knowledge in your brain. Even as a beginner you have something to teach you don't have to be an expert before you start.

Another thing it does is that, you get the chance to go through the topic again from the basics and you get to learn and understand some concepts you struggled with during the first try.

For example, I remember the first time I learned the [[css box model]], I don't quite understand it fully and because of the pace and logs of things that I need to learn I couldn't get the opportunity to revisit it but as I decided to start teaching & mentoring others, I have to revisit the topic, there is a saying which says you can't give what you don't have, my point here is if I don't understand this concept myself how can I teach others, you don't want to appear incompetent before your students i guess not.

You get better at explaining technical & communicating technical jargon

## Teaching advantages
- Perform better in programming interview questions
	- those basic interview questions that throws people off their game after learning so many advance programming concepts will have stuck after teaching it to others
- It also increase metacognitive self-regulation, conceptual formulation of problems and, eventually, their ability to solve those problems you can check the following citation for more info [Relative benefits of learning by teaching](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247768656_The_relative_benefits_of_learning_by_teaching_and_teaching_expectancy).
- It makes you a continuous learner & opportunities for growth
	- Teaching others make you a continuous learner, as they say that no good teacher will ever feels that they truly know everything there is to know. Basically you become a life student and this gives room for continuous improvement and career growth. 
- Opportunity to make a difference e.g khan academy, read couple of testimonies for CS student learning algo and other complex subject on YouTube from a guy from India which the college does not teach very well. Thanking this individuals for the impacts those teaching have in the career.

### Ways you can teach 
- An article about a problem you recently solved
	- What was the problem and how you solved it?
