The best way to learn is by teaching others what you have learnt. Explaining what you have learned to someone else will forces you to reword i.e. put it your own word and helps in revisiting it from ground up. It is also a perfect way to test if you've truly internalized something.

Sharing newly learned skills & knowledge helps solidifying the newly acquired knowledge in your brain. Even as a beginner you have something to teach.
