Write about teach

There is a psychology behind writing things down, unconsciously you find yourself doing what you wrote down. Next underestimate the power of setting a goal and having a to-dos.

Writing things down helps us to remember once we've written it down simply because we are force to repeat what we have read or hear when trying to write it down. A form of repetition of learning and can also serves as a first point of reference.


Another good way to improve learning is putting new knowledge & skills into practice. Learning to code is hard but with consistent practice your learning will improve and concepts will stick quickly.

Teach everything you know.
